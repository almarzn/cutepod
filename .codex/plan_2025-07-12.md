# Plan for Cutepod (2025-07-12)

## Project Understanding
- Cutepod is an ephemeral, Kubernetes-inspired orchestration tool for local container management using Podman.
- Uses declarative YAML charts with Go templating similar to Helm charts.
- Supports resource kinds: CuteContainer, CutePod, CuteNetwork, CuteVolume, CuteSecret, CuteSecretStore, and CuteExtension.
- Provides CLI commands for linting, installing, upgrading, and reinitializing workloads.
- Designed to be daemonless and ephemeral, with declarative reconciliation of Podman resources.
- Requires Go 1.24+, Podman, libpod, and runs on Linux or macOS (rootless Podman supported).

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Project Setup & Planning**
   - Initialize repository structure and Go module.
   - Establish CLI entrypoint and command stubs.
   - Create .codex workspace and initial documentation.
2. **Phase 2: Chart Rendering & Validation**
   - Parse chart.yaml and values.yaml.
   - Render templates with Go templating and validate YAML structure.
3. **Phase 3: Core Resource Reconciliation**
   - Implement reconciliation logic for CuteContainer, CutePod, CuteNetwork, CuteVolume, CuteSecret, and CuteSecretStore.
4. **Phase 4: Extensibility via CuteExtension**
   - Implement transformer runner for custom resource kinds.
5. **Phase 5: CLI Commands & Reinit Logic**
   - Flesh out install, upgrade, and reinit commands with --dry-run support.
6. **Phase 6: Testing & Documentation**
   - Add unit and integration tests for critical functionality.
   - Update README.md with usage examples and finalize documentation.

## Assumptions
- CLI framework choice (e.g., Cobra) is not specified in README; will document selection rationale in README when chosen.
- Logging and output formatting conventions will follow standard Go CLI practices.
- Testing approach will use Go's built-in testing framework.
- Repository will adhere to Go recommended project layout as per completion criteria.
