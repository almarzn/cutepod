# Plan for 2025-07-12

## Project Understanding
- Cutepod is a CLI tool for local container orchestration using Podman, inspired by Kubernetes.
- It uses declarative YAML charts with Go templating to manage containers, networks, volumes, secrets, and extensions.

## Key Components & Features
- Kubernetes-inspired syntax (Helm-like charts).
- Declarative reconciliation (install, upgrade, lint, reinit commands).
- Resource kinds: CuteContainer, CutePod, CuteNetwork, CuteVolume, CuteSecret, CuteSecretStore, CuteExtension.
- Secret management (inline secrets and external secret injection).
- Extension mechanism (transform custom resources via runner containers).
- Chart parsing and Go template rendering.
- Podman CLI integration (no daemon).
- Restart recovery (reinit command after restart).

## Development Phases
1. Chart parsing and linting (`cutepod lint`).
2. Template rendering and value injection.
3. Resource handlers and reconciliation logic (`install` and `upgrade`).
4. Secret management and secret store integration.
5. Extension runner support.
6. Reinit/restart recovery implementation.
7. Testing and integration tests.
8. CLI UX refinements and documentation.

## Assumptions
- User has Podman and Go 1.24+ installed (per README requirements).
- Linux/macOS environment (rootless Podman supported).
- Charts use Go templating only (no additional templating engines).
- No Kubernetes server or API; purely CLI and Podman-based.

## Next Steps
- ✅ Created initial plan and log files.
- 🔄 Begin implementation of chart parsing and linting.
- ⛔️ None currently.
