# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will generate Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) files for all Cutepod resource types, making them compatible with Kubernetes tooling and enabling validation, documentation, and IDE support. The generated CRDs will follow Kubernetes OpenAPI v3 schema standards and can be used for validation, kubectl integration, and developer tooling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Cutepod, I want CRD files for all resource types, so that I can use Kubernetes tooling for validation, documentation, and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating CRDs THEN the system SHALL create valid Kubernetes CRD YAML files for all Cutepod resource types (CuteContainer, CutePod, CuteNetwork, CuteVolume, CuteSecret, CuteSecretStore, CuteExtension)
2. WHEN examining CRD files THEN the system SHALL include complete OpenAPI v3 schemas with field descriptions, data types, and validation constraints
3. WHEN using CRDs THEN the system SHALL follow Kubernetes API conventions including apiVersion, kind, metadata, and spec structures
4. IF a field has validation rules THEN the CRD SHALL include proper OpenAPI validation constraints (pattern, minimum, maximum, enum, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a tool developer integrating with Cutepod, I want CRD files for documentation and validation purposes, so that I can understand resource schemas and build validation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining CRD files THEN the system SHALL provide complete OpenAPI v3 schemas that document all fields and their types
2. WHEN building validation tools THEN the system SHALL provide CRDs with proper validation constraints for automated checking
3. WHEN using IDEs THEN the system SHALL provide CRDs that enable schema-based autocompletion and validation for YAML files
4. IF integrating with documentation tools THEN the system SHALL provide CRDs that can be used to generate API documentation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Kubernetes user adopting Cutepod, I want CRDs that follow Kubernetes conventions for documentation purposes, so that I can leverage my existing knowledge of Kubernetes resource structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining CRD structures THEN the system SHALL use standard Kubernetes CRD format with apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
2. WHEN defining resource schemas THEN the system SHALL follow Kubernetes OpenAPI v3 schema patterns with proper metadata, spec, and status sections
3. WHEN working with resources THEN the system SHALL use standard Kubernetes field naming conventions and validation patterns
4. IF documenting resources THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with Kubernetes documentation patterns and field descriptions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining Cutepod, I want automated CRD generation from Go types, so that CRDs stay synchronized with code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Go resource types are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically regenerate corresponding CRD files
2. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL validate that CRDs are up-to-date with Go type definitions
3. WHEN adding new resource fields THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in generated CRDs with proper OpenAPI validation
4. IF CRD generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which types or fields caused issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a chart author, I want CRD-based validation during chart linting, so that I can catch configuration errors before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `cutepod lint` THEN the system SHALL validate all resource definitions against their CRD schemas
2. WHEN CRD validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages with file paths and line numbers
3. WHEN validating templates THEN the system SHALL support validation of both raw YAML and templated output using CRD schemas
4. IF a resource uses custom extensions THEN the system SHALL validate extension-specific fields according to their CRD definitions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer using external tools, I want CRDs published in standard locations, so that I can use them for documentation and validation purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing CRDs THEN the system SHALL provide them in a standard directory structure (e.g., `crds/` or `schemas/crds/`)
2. WHEN integrating with documentation tools THEN the system SHALL provide CRDs in standard Kubernetes CRD format for schema extraction
3. WHEN using validation libraries THEN the system SHALL provide CRDs that can be parsed to extract OpenAPI schemas for validation
4. IF CRDs are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility or provide clear migration guidance with versioning

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer learning Cutepod, I want comprehensive markdown documentation with working examples, so that I can understand how to use all resource types and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL provide complete markdown documentation for all Cutepod resource types with field descriptions and usage guidance
2. WHEN learning about resources THEN the system SHALL include working YAML examples for each resource type that can be copied and used directly
3. WHEN checking feature status THEN the system SHALL maintain a clear list of implemented features, in-progress features, and planned features
4. IF exploring advanced usage THEN the system SHALL provide examples showing resource relationships, templating, and complex configurations
